## Important Info
This App does **not** work on Windows 11, due to a change in the Windows 11 code that causes Applications using [bitsdojo_window](https://github.com/bitsdojo/bitsdojo_window) to crash instantly.
To "fix" this you need to remove the 2 lines of code required for this package to function propertly.
I submitted an issue to the author of the package, but for now this is the best workaround.
